    "> Meanwhile biorthogonal wavelets got a very popular image processing tool, alternative multiresolution transforms have been proposed for solving some of their drawbacks, namely the poor selectivity in orientation and the lack of translation invariance due to the aliasing between subbands. These transforms are generally overcomplete and consequently offer huge degrees of freedom in their design. At the same time their optimization get a challenging task. We proposed here a log-Gabor wavelet transform gathering the excellent mathematical properties of the Gabor functions with a carefully construction to maintain the properties of the filters and to permit exact reconstruction. Two major improvements are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. And second, all the frequency bands including the highest and lowest frequencies are uniformly covered so as exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible). The transform is optimized not only mathematically but it also follows as much as possible the knowledge on the receptive field of the simple cells of the Primary Visual Cortex (V1) of primates and on the statistics of natural images. Compared to the state of the art, the log-Gabor wavelets show excellent behavior in their ability to segregate the image information (e.g. the contrast edges) from incoherent Gaussian noise by hard thresholding and to code the image features through a reduced set of coefficients with large magnitude. Such characteristics make the transform a promising tool for general image processing tasks.\n",

    "An important task in image processing and related areas (such as understanding principles of vision)  involves defining a dictionary of templates (or\n",
    "filters) for detecting edges. This representation should give a generic model of edges parameterized by their shape, orientation, and scale. Moreover the range of these parameters should match with what has been reported for simple-cell responses in macaque primary visual cortex (V1). As such,  standard Gabors are classically used as they are well fitted to V1 simple cells (Daugman, 1980).\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly proposed by Dennis Gabor in 1946, the canonical coherent states of the Gabor filters are different versions of a Gaussian-shaped window shifted in time/space and frequency variables. Subsequently Morlet brought them into the wavelet multi-resolution framework and they are called Gabor wavelets as well. Belonging to the large Cohen's class, Gabor's work synthesizes the studies of Nyquist in Communication Theory in 1924 and Heisenberg in Quantum Mechanics in 1927, by which he proposed the Gaussian shape as an optimal envelope for time-frequency representation because it turns the uncertainly principle from inequality into equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important characteristics of Gabor wavelets are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. the Gabor transform is obtained through a linear convolution, \n",
    "1. it may enable complete image recovery, \n",
    "1. the transform domain contains fully the energy of the signal (Parseval's theorem), 1. it is not orthogonal but an unconditional basis, a frame, \n",
    "1. the Fourier plane is symmetric and \n",
    "1. it is invariant to shifting in time/space, frequency and scale. \n",
    "1. Gabor filters are completely symmetric of both sides (isotropy), monomodal and centered (localization) and smooth and infinitely derivable (regularity). \n",
    "1. In the case of bidimensional signals (images), the scaled versions even can be rotated. The result is the partition of the Fourier plane into bands modulated in frequency and orientation which discriminate spectral features in multiples directions. In contrast, (bi-)orthogonal wavelets often have well-known difficulties in implementing more than three orientations (horizontal, vertical and diagonal). \n",
    "1. In addition, the Gaussian envelop is modulated by a complex exponential with odd and even phases, which is effective for analyzing features with different phases as abrupt impulses or steps, i.e. ridges and edges in 2D respectively. The filter results of a symmetric and an antisymmetric filter can be combined in a single complex number whose squared amplitude is called the Gabor-energy. This activity relates to the response of so-called complex cells in the primary visual cortex (see H. Spitzer and S. Hochstein. A complex-cell receptive-field model. *Journal of Neuroscience, 53(5):1266–1286, 1985*).\n",

    "Gabor filters are a traditional choice for obtaining localised frequency information. It is worth stressing here other important aspects in that peculiar shape. Despite its Gaussian shape spreads to infinite, it decays rapidly from its center. They offer the best simultaneous localization of spatial and frequency information. However they have two main limitations. The maximum bandwidth of a Gabor filter is limited to approximately one octave and Gabor filters are not optimal if one is seeking broad spectral information with maximal spatial localization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations are well illustrated by focusing on the DC component. Indeed, one cannot construct Gabor functions of arbitrarily wide bandwidth and still maintain a reasonably small DC component in the even-symmetric filter. This difficulty can be seen if we look at the transfer function of an even-symmetric Gabor filter in the frequency domain. The transfer function is the sum of two Gaussians centred at plus and minus the centre frequency. If the standard deviation of these Gaussians becomes more than about one third of the centre frequency the tails of the two Gaussians will start to overlap excessively at the origin, resulting in a nonzero DC component.\n",

    "a wide range of natural images~\\citep{Fischer07}.\n",
    "Like Gabors, these filters are defined by Gaussians in Fourier space,\n",
    "but their specificity is that log-Gabors have Gaussians envelopes in log-polar frequency space.\n",
    "This is consistent with physiological measurements which indicate that V1 cell responses are symmetric on the log frequency scale.\n",
    "They have multiple advantages over Gaussians:\n",
    "In particular, they have no DC component,\n",
    "and more generally, their envelopes more broadly cover the frequency space~\\citep{Fischer07cv}.\n",

Unfortunately due to the singularity in the log function at the origin one cannot construct an analytic expression for the shape of the log Gabor function in the spatial domain. One is reduced to designing the filters in the frequency domain and then performing a numerical inverse Fourier Transform to see what they look like. Their appearance is similar to Gabor functions though their shape becomes much \"sharper\" as the bandwidth is increased.
